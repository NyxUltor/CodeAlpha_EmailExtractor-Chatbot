# ChatBot-Task4-Alphacode
Rule-based chatbot with anime personality

# Chatbot — CodeAlpha Internship Task 4

This project was created for **Task 4** of the CodeAlpha Python Internship.  
It is a simple chatbot that replies to user input using basic conditionals and functions.

# Goal

Build a simple rule-based chatbot using Python

Chosen Task:  
✔ Respond to inputs like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, and `"bye"` with predefined replies

---

# Key Concepts Used

- `if-elif` — for rule-based response logic  
- `functions` — to manage responses cleanly  
- `loops` — to keep the chatbot running  
- `input/output` — for user interaction  
- `random` — for something special 

# How It Works

1. The user types a message (example: `"hello"` or `"bye"`)
2. The chatbot responds with a matching reply
3. For unknown inputs, it returns a **random message**
4. Typing `"bye"` exits the conversation with a **farewell quote**

# Sample Inputs

- `"hello"`  
- `"how are you"`  
- `"bye"`  
- or just anything — the bot will still say something ✨
  
# To Run This Project

1. Save the file as `chatbot.py`  
2. Make sure Python is installed  
3. Run the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py

##NOTE
A special version has be put alongside the basic version for anime enthusiasts it isn't too special but just an addition of mine
